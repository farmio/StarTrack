#StarTrack

monitor old Rainstars

##Disclaimer

This is my very first Python project and my first project on GitHub.
I'm trying to advance in both as this project progresses.

##Description

Monitoring of piston driven reel irrigation systems (eg. Bauer Rainstar 1975-1995) with a RaspberryPi

##Goals

Software

- [ ] measure the current retraction speed
  - [ ] calculate the remaining irrigation time
  - [ ] calculate current water / area
- [ ] communicate over 3G
  - [ ] alert when retraction is finished / has stopped
  - [ ] post status to a server (every half hour ?)

Hardware

- [ ] load battery
  - [ ] with photovoltaic cell
  - [ ] with generator driven by the exhausted water from the piston drive
- [ ] regulate retraction speed

##Hardware

My hardware:

- 1x Bauer Rainstar (90-400 ? from ~1985)
- 1x RaspberryPi Model B (512 MB Ram)
- 2x Inductive proximity sensor Omron E2B-M12KS04-WP-B2 2M

##Licence

I'm doing this in my spare time and I don't want to consume it with studying different types of licences. Do what you want with this on your own risk.
